# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts whether a telecom customer will churn (leave the service) using machine learning models. Businesses can use these predictions to improve customer retention.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Telco Customer Churn - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Size: 7,043 rows, 21 features

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (for deployment)

## 🚀 Steps
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
4. Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
5. Confusion matrix and feature importance visualization  

## ✅ Results
- Best model: **XGBoost**
- Accuracy: ~89%
- Precision/Recall balanced performance
